# Reiki

Reiki is a system of vibrational therapy that induces deep relaxation allowing stress to be released and eventually returns the body to a natural stage of balance.  A balanced body more easily maintains health and well being.

The ability to learn Reiki is not dependent on intellectual capacity, nor does one have to be able to meditate. It does not take years of practice. It is simply passed on from the teacher to the student. As soon as this happens, one has and can do Reiki. Because of this, it is easily learned by anyone.

If you want to start a healing arts practice or improve an existing healing arts practice, Reiki is the ideal service to offer from both a health/wellness and business perspective!

You can tap into an unlimited supply of "life force energy" to improve your health and enhance the quality of your life by taking Reiki training or receiving Reiki treatments.

## Reiki Therapy

Reiki is the energy which animates us and is found all around us. In Japanese, REI is universal or all encompassing spirit. KI describes the subtle system of life sustaining energy circulating in all living things. Reiki means universal life force energy and is pronounced ‘ray-key’.  

Reiki further describes a form of treatment using "universal life force energy" conducted through the practitioner to the recipient.  Reiki helps to harmonize the body, mind and spirit. 

### What to expect

The one receiving a Reiki treatment lies, fully clothed, on a Reiki or massage table. He or she can also receive a treatment while sitting on a chair. The Reiki practitioner holds her hands on or above the person.  A treatment lasts half an hour or longer, depending on the treatment required.  In the western world many Reiki practitioners use the standard hand positions – she never touches private areas of the body - and commonly a full treatment is given covering all the important organs.

There is no pressure on the body and this makes it ideal for treating all ages and conditions - including arthritis. The energy flows wherever it is required and can normally be felt as a warm sensation or tingling in the body. Receiving Reiki is a very relaxing and soothing experience!                                                                                                                                   
Reiki is a gentle, yet profound, non-invasive therapy

The person who has been attuned to Reiki can provide treatments to self and others.  Reiki can be used to alleviate pain and discomfort from headaches, stomach upsets, asthma, menstrual problems, sinus, anxiety, and many more. Reiki is not a medical treatment and should never be used to replace it. It is a complementary form of therapy which means it works well with other therapies and treatments.

Reiki is not a religion. It holds no dogma, doctrines, creeds or contradictions to the universal laws of consciousness and unconditional love. Therefore, no belief system is necessary for this energy to flow.  Reiki is both a powerful and gentle treatment that:

* Energizes naturally, safely, and quickly
* Balances the energies in the body
* Strengthens the immune system 
* Relieves pain
* Relaxes and reduces stress
* Increases positive thinking and supports the natural healing process
* Promotes from within the qualities of love, care, growth, compassion and trust

## Reiki and Massage Therapy

As we have been teaching Reiki, we have discovered that Registered Massage Therapists who have taken the training have found it beneficial for themselves and their clients.  They report that they are less tired after giving many treatments in a day.  They have also received comments from their clients that their massage treatments seem to have an added quality.  It also seems that the effect continues for more time with better sleep and less stress.  These comments have even been provided by clients who were not aware that their RMT was adding Reiki to the treatment.

Reiki is easy to learn and once learned can be incorporated into treatments, to one’s personal life to reduce stress and pain, and to treat other family members – and even pets!  One can learn Reiki I & II over a 2-day period.  We offer a schedule to meet the needs of very busy Registered Massage Therapists – Monday to Sunday.
