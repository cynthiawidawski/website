# Access Consciousness Body Processes

An Access Consciousness Body Process is a hands-on method that uses different hand placements on various positions on the body and then asking specific energies to run at each spot. These processes facilitate the body back into its original functions, which assist with the repairing and longevity of the body. The energies are the natural energies that bodies are and have access to from everywhere in the universe.

Access Body Processes are about receiving powerful energetic processes that go beyond the cognitive mind, to bring our bodies and beings into communion and to facilitate the earth.

## MTVSS – Immune System Process

MTVSS can have an incredibly dynamic effect on the immune system.
MTVSS stands for about a thousand different things. We are activating these energies within your body. It’s all the ways in which you have locked up your body, thinking that this reality is the sum total of what you can do or be.  In order for some toxin to be in your body and for it to release, all chemicals combine with one another and in order for it to release from your body it has to slough off a positive or negative charge to be able to release. So we lock a whole lot of stuff into our body because we are unable to release it because we are not able to slough off that positive or negative point of view. So MTVSS will actually eliminate a whole lot of difficulties that you are having with your body.

MTVSS is often the “tool of choice” for undoing almost any way the body is malfunctioning. Gary Douglas, founder of Access Consciousness says that having it done weekly for 10 weeks your body will start to show up as it was designed to be.

### Benefits of receiving MTVSS:

* Stimulating and boosting the immune system
* Easing difficulties in different parts of the body
* Rejuvenating the organs
* Balancing and rejuvenating the  different body systems

Metabolism - Respiratory - Central Nervous System - Skeletal - Digestive - Reproductive - Lymphatic & Hormone System

## Square Root of Minus One

The Square Root of Minus One is a hands on process that allows the body to dynamically overcome what are considered to be normal human diseases.  The Square Root of Minus One can eliminate colds and flu in a few hours and changes your whole immune system and the structure in which it functions. It can be used for insomnia and arthritis.

The Square root of -1 is theoretically an imaginary number.  In actuality it exists as a place where we hide all things in the body.

## Lymphatic Glandular Incongruities & Inconsistencies

This process, Lymphatic and Glandular Incongruities and Inconsistencies, can assist with the lymph and glandular systems primarily to help with hearing, as well as ear and sinus congestion.

## Corrective Vision Process

This process works on helping the eyes to better vision. It may also help on sinus problems as well.

## THE ACCESS CONSCIOUSNESS FACELIFT ™

This process works on rejuvenating the cells of the neck and face for a more youthful look.  Is it possible to feel and look younger WITHOUT injecting botulism, acupuncture needles or creating other trauma to your body? The Access Consciousness Facelift™ is an amazing process which can reverse the appearance of aging on the face and can create similar effects throughout the body.  If done repeatedly (at least 20 times) it appears to be permanent. The Access Consciousness Facelift™  differs from other alternatives out there in that it’s gentler, kinder and easier on you and your body. How does it get any better than that?

## BMM Biomimetic Mimicry

BMM is a body process that changes where we create our lives and our bodies from mimicking others instead of by choice.

Biomimetic is what you lock into your body trying to duplicate or understand others. It is a natural ability of the body to be able to fit into the rest of the world. You mimic others pathways and point of views when you need to understand them from an intellectual or energetic point of view and that requires you to lock the similarities into your body in order to have clarity from your point of view to theirs.
